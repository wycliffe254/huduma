<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

> Describe how a new developer could make use of your project.
Learning Opportunities:

1.Diverse Skill Development: Developing a service app involves working on various aspects such as user interfaces, backend logic, database management, and third-party integrations. This provides an excellent opportunity for new developers to diversify their skill set.
2.Real-world Application: Working on a practical project allows new developers to apply theoretical knowledge gained from coursework, translating academic learning into real-world coding experience.
Project Portfolio Enhancement:

3.Showcasing Abilities: Completing a service app project provides new developers with a tangible product to include in their portfolio. This becomes a valuable asset when applying for internships or entry-level positions.
GitHub Contributions: Hosting the project on platforms like GitHub allows new developers to showcase their coding practices and collaborate with others, further boosting their visibility within the developer community.
Problem-solving and Innovation:

4.Addressing Real Issues: Developing a service app involves identifying problems in the current service-based applications and proposing innovative solutions. This fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills among new developers.
5.Innovative Features: Introducing unique features in the app demonstrates creativity and the ability to think outside the box, setting new developers apart in a competitive landscape.
Collaboration and Communication:

6.Team Collaboration: In larger projects, new developers can experience collaboration with others, learning how to integrate their code with contributions from different team members.
7.Client Interaction: If the project involves client interactions, new developers gain exposure to client requirements, feedback, and communication an essential aspect of real-world software development.
Community Engagement:

8.Engaging with Users: Building a service app provides an opportunity for new developers to engage with potential users, gaining insights into user preferences and needs.
9.Networking: Actively participating in forums, discussions, and seeking feedback on the app fosters connections within the developer community, opening doors to mentorship and collaborative opportunities.

In summary, developing a service app is not only a coding exercise but a holistic learning experience that enhances technical skills, portfolio attractiveness, problem-solving abilities, and community engagement for new and student developers.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

-Install the necessary development tools, including a compatible Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g., AndroidStudio), version control system (e.g., Git), and relevant SDKs.

### Setup
 -Using command prompt/terminal navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
 -Clone the project repository using this link: https://github.com/wycliffe254/huduma.git
### Install

Launch Android Studio.
Click on "Open an existing Android Studio project" or "File" > "Open".
Select the directory where you cloned your repository.

### Configure Firebase
To set up Firebase, follow these steps:

1.Create a new Firebase project using the Firebase Console.
2.Add your Android app to the Firebase project and carefully follow the provided setup instructions to establish the connection.
3.Download the google-services.json file from Firebase and ensure it is placed in the app module of your project.
### Build and Run:
After setting up firebase:

1.Wait for Android Studio to synchronize the project and download the required dependencies.
2.Connect your Android device (either a physical device or emulator) to your computer.
3.Click the "Run" button (green triangle) in Android Studio to initiate the build and installation of the app on your connected device. Make sure to choose the target device when prompted.

### Review
After completion, review the app by exploring its various screens. Make any modifications or adjustments according to your preferences.

### Run tests
To run tests, execute the following command:

Write comprehensive unit tests and UI tests to verify that the app's functionality aligns with expectations.

Utilize testing tools such as JUnit and Espresso for effective testing.

Unit tests concentrate on validating individual components or functions independently. Follow these steps to write and execute unit tests for your app:

### Create a Test Class:

Within your project, initiate a new directory – commonly labeled as "test" – beneath the src folder.
Inside this newly created directory, generate a Kotlin class tailored for your unit tests. Consider naming it something like HudumaViewTest.

### Write Test Methods:

### Define test methods within your test class.
Use JUnit annotations (@Test, @Before, @After, etc.) to set up and execute tests.
Test various scenarios, such as ViewModel logic, data transformations, or utility functions.

### Mock Dependencies:

Use mock objects or dependency injection to isolate the component you’re testing.
For example, if you’re testing a ViewModel, mock the repository or data source.
### Run Tests:

After creating your unit tests in the "HudumaViewTest" class, you can execute them by following these steps:

1.Right-click on your test class ("HudumaViewTest").
2.Select “Run” from the context menu.

After running the tests, observe the results in the Android Studio console. This will provide information on whether the tests passed or if there are any failures or errors.
### Deployment
To deploy and publish your app on the Google Play Store, follow these steps:

1.Create a Google Developer Account:

If you haven’t already, create a Google Play Developer account by paying a one-time fee of $25.
Navigate to the Google Play Console.

2.Create Your App:

Log in to the Google Play Console.
Select “All apps” and click “Create app”.
Choose a default language and provide the name of your app as you want it to appear on Google Play.
Specify whether your app is an app or a game, and whether it’s free or paid.
Add an email address for user inquiries related to your app.

3.Set Up Your App:

After creating your app, you’ll be guided through essential steps:
Content Details: Provide information about your app’s content.
Store Listing: Enter details like app description, screenshots, and promotional graphics.
App Release: Manage pre-release testing, version management, and promotion.
Launch Your App: Make your app available to users on Google Play.

4.Upload Your App Bundle:

Build an Android App Bundle (AAB) using Android Studio.
Sign the release version of your app.
Upload the AAB to the Google Play Console.
Google Play will generate APKs optimized for different device configurations.

5.Test Your App Internally:

Use the app bundle explorer in the Play Console to inspect APKs generated from your bundle.
Test your app on different devices and configurations.

6.Publish Your App:

Once you’re satisfied with testing, click “Review” in the Play Console.
Review your app’s details and settings.
Click “Start rollout to production” to publish your app.

7.Monitor and Update:

Regularly check the Play Console for user reviews, ratings, and any issues.
Update your app as needed, fix bugs, and enhance features.
